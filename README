An SML/NJ smackage. (Sort of.)

This package isn't *really* a package of SML/NJ. SML/NJ has a wacky
subversion repo layout that I didn't really want to deal with
mirroring in git.

This package is a simple script to fetch and build SML/NJ and a simple
script to install symlinks to the sml/nj binaries in a useful place.

This is then packaged up as a smackage to make it easy to get an
sml/nj install.

SML/NJ doesn't version according to the semantic versioning spec, but
for now we are reusing the SML/NJ version number for our version. SML
version 110.XX will be 110.XX.0. If they release backwards
incompatible changes or actully release 111, we will have to increment
to 111.0.0 and will feel stupid.
